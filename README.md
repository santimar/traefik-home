# Traefik Home
![preview](/doc/preview.jpg)

This tool will create a homepage for quick access to the domains where containers are exposed via [traefik proxy](https://traefik.io/traefik/) using v2 configuration. (for old v1 configuration see [here](https://github.com/lobre/traefik-home))

Domains are automatically retrieved reading traefik labels and only http(s) routers are supported.

## Why this tool

Traefik is a reverse proxy that reads label on the docker compose file and automatically set up itself, so that you can access a service on a container with the specified hostname.
Even though Traefik provides a dashboard that allow you to see services that are proxied, you still have to remember (or save somewhere) all the hostnames in order to access your services.
This tool creates a Home page where all hostnames all listed, for easy access.

It uses [docker-gen](https://github.com/jwilder/docker-gen) to monitor docker configuration changes and render a web page that will be served using `nginx`
This way changes are immediately reflected whenever something gets updated.

## Usage

For a quick preview you can just run the image with the following docker run command:

```
docker run --name traefik-home \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro \
    --label traefik.enable=true \
    --label traefik.http.routers.traefik-home.rule="Host(`home.example.com`)" \
    --label traefik.http.services.traefik-home.loadbalancer.server.port="80" \
    ghcr.io/santimar/traefik-home:latest
```

Wait for the service to be online, then go to `home.example.com` and enjoy the view.

For long runs however, the docker-compose file is a better approach.

## Docker compose
```yaml
version: '3'

services:
  traefik-home:
    image: ghcr.io/santimar/traefik-home:latest  # or use a specific tag version
    container_name: traefik-home
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
    labels:
      - traefik.enable="true"
      - traefik.http.routers.traefik-home.rule="Host(`home.example.com`)"
      - traefik.http.services.traefik-home.loadbalancer.server.port="80"

  other-service:
    image: ...
    labels:
      # see below for more info about exposed containers configuration
      - traefik-home.icon: "https://url/of/an/icon.png"
      - traefik-home.alias: "Alias"
    
```

## Labels to configure Home

The `traefik-home` container can be configured using the following optional labels.

| Label  | Description | Default
| --- | --- | --- |
| traefik-home.show-footer | Whether to show footer on the home page | true |
| traefik-home.show-status-dot | Whether to show green/red status dot near the container name | true |
| traefik-home.sort-by | Container list sort order. Supported values are "default" (container creation date) or "name" | "default" |
| traefik-home.open-link-in-new-tab | Whether to open services link in a new tab | false |
| traefik-home.https-entrypoints | List of https entrypoints to show. <br> Example: `traefik-home.https-entrypoints=websecure1,websecure2` | websecure |
| traefik-home.http-entrypoints | List of http entrypoints to show. <br> Example: `traefik-home.http-entrypoints=websecure1,websecure2` | web |

## Labels to configure containers

Home will use the following `traefik` labels to generate the HTML page.

| Label  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| traefik.http.routers.\<service\>.rule | Domain and path used by Home to generate the link to the service |
| traefik.enable | Only explicitly enabled container are shown on the homepage |

<details>
<summary>note about setting multiple domains and/or paths on the same rule</summary>

---
Traefik allows you to set multiple domains and path on the same rule like 
```
Host(`example.org`) && PathPrefix(`/path`) || Host(`domain.com`) && Path(`/path`)
```
However Traefik-Home will only use the first `Host` and `Path/PathPrefix` found within the rule.

In this example, the app will be available at `example.org/path`, ignoring the other domain.

Also, keep in mind that using a rule like 
```
Host(`example.org`) || Host(`domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/path`)
```
will create a link to `example.org/path`.

In a situation like this, you just have to rewrite the rule like 
```
Host(`example.org`) && PathPrefix(`/`) || Host(`domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/path`)
```
or like 
```
Host(`domain.com`) && PathPrefix(`/path`) || Host(`example.org`)
```

</details>

On each exposed container, the following optional labels can be added to provide a personalized configuration.

| Label  | Description |
| --- | --- |
| traefik-home.hide="true" | Do not show this container in the home page |
| traefik-home.icon="https://url/of/icon"  | URL of an image that will be used as icon for the container. If this label is not used, a icon with the container's initials will be used |
| traefik-home.alias="alias"  | If used, the alias will be shown instead of the container name |

<details>
<summary>serving self-hosted icons</summary>

`traefik-home.icon` must be an URL, but since `traefik-home` runs on `nginx`, we can take advandage of it and serve self-hosted icons as well.

You will need to mount icon file(s) to `/usr/share/nginx/html/icons/` folder on `traefik-home` container like:

```yaml
traefik-home:
   image: ghcr.io/santimar/traefik-home:latest
   volumes:
       - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:ro
       - "/path/to/your/icon.svg:/usr/share/nginx/html/icons/my-icon.svg:ro"
   labels:
       - "traefik.enable=true"
       - "traefik.http.routers.traefik-home.rule=Host(`dashboard.localhost`)"
 ```

And then reference it in other container labels like so:
```yaml
   - "traefik-home.icon=http://dashboard.localhost/icons/my-icon.svg"
```
</details>

## Update

When a new release is available, just:
```
docker pull ghcr.io/santimar/traefik-home:latest
```

and then 

```
docker-compose up -d traefik-home 
```
